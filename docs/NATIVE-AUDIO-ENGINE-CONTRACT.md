# Native audio engine contract

Status: compiled memory-safe DSP/offline proof plus tested host contracts; not a
production real-time audio engine

## Compiled Swift package

`native/SharedDspEngine` is a SwiftPM package with three products:

| Product | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SharedDspEngine` | Memory-safe Swift implementation of shared DSP contract v2 |
| `shared-dsp-self-test` | Compiled bounds, bypass, recovery, and sample-rate reset checks |
| `shared-dsp-golden-runner` | Binary Float32 bridge used only for cross-language parity verification |

The processing method performs no file, network, UI, logging, or explicit
allocation work. Hosts own the input/output buffers. Reset and sample-rate
reconfiguration are control-thread operations and may replace state arrays.
The implementation uses checked Swift arrays and contains no unsafe pointer or
foreign-memory code.

Run:

```bash
npm run dsp:native:verify
```

The command builds with the Xcode Swift toolchain, runs the compiled self-test,
and compares 16 native renders against the four reviewed contract-v2 fixtures
at 1, 17, 128, and 511 frames. A passing run reports
`implementation: "swift"` and `comparisons: 16`.

On the current development machine, the Xcode installation does not expose a
macOS XCTest or Swift Testing module. `swift test` therefore cannot host tests,
so the package uses a compiled self-test executable plus the stronger binary
golden-parity verifier. This is an environment limitation, not a claim that a
SwiftPM test suite passed.

## Host protocol

`src/lib/native-audio-engine-contract.js` defines the boundary that a later
signed local engine must implement:

- protocol version 1 and exact shared-DSP contract version
- semantic engine version, per-launch instance ID, and implementation
  fingerprint
- bounded capabilities for offline rendering, real-time output, device
  notification, channels, and sample rates
- explicit device request with input/output IDs, channel counts, sample rate,
  buffer size, exclusive mode, and safe default-device fallback

Handshake version drift fails closed. Device identifiers and engine telemetry
are machine-local runtime data and must not enter project JSON or cloud sync.

## Latency authority

Latency is recorded in integer frames first. Milliseconds are derived display
values. The report separates:

- input and output hardware latency
- one callback buffer on each path
- DSP/lookahead latency
- future plug-in latency
- host safety offset
- input path, output path, and round-trip totals

This prevents the UI from presenting one unexplained latency number and gives a
future compensation engine exact frame authority.

## Dropout and device recovery

The telemetry state machine is:

```text
stopped -> starting -> running -> degraded
                         |           |
                         v           v
                     recovering -> running
                         |
                         v
                       failed
```

Callback records count frame mismatches, deadline misses, aggregate xruns,
non-finite sample recoveries, and the longest callback. Device loss requires an
explicit `recovering` state and an explicit return to `running`; it cannot be
reported as healthy merely because a later callback arrived. The bounded event
log stores reason codes and timestamps, never absolute paths or audio data.

## Remaining production work

This checkpoint does not provide Core Audio/AVAudioEngine device enumeration,
a hardware callback, aggregate-device support, hot-plug notifications, WASM,
background service lifecycle, production IPC, or production offline printing.
The Swift runner is a test bridge and is not packaged into the app. Production
promotion still requires real device-loss tests, callback allocation profiling,
latency measurement against hardware, native manifest fingerprints, and the
same source-safe rendered-audio checks used by the existing FFmpeg path.
